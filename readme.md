This is one Solution to Udacitys Landing Page Project.

A Blog about e Mountainbikes serves as Playground.

The Page needs to be responsive.
A Navigation Menu has to be added via JS.
Further we had to use JS to add a "active" class to the blog post thats in the view.

The last thing to add, is a smooth scroll behavior.
